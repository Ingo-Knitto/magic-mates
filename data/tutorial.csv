tutorial basic movement	Welcome to the first tutorial. Try to move your mate by clicking “move” on the right side, then choose a destination.	Check out the 4 bars on top of your mate: Health in red, armor in green, mana in blue and time in white. The time bar empties after each turn and refills over time. When full, the time bar turns yellow and your mates next turn begins. Check it out and move a little, or continue the tutorial by trying out rookies charge.	Good. As you may have thought, rookie charge allows your mate to move like a rook in chess. Pun not intended. Next, try bishop charge.	Easy, right? Now thats how the bishop moves. You may have noticed that normal movement does not use all of your time bar, but only half of it. Major abilities like rookie and bishop charge need the full time bar. Minor abilities like normal move, passing the turn or knights move only use half of it. Finish this tutorial by jumping like a knight.	Well done. You can continue to move a little, and check out how mana and time bars work, but you will probably want to fight. Check out the next tutorial when you are ready.’			
tutorial basic attacking	Look, an enemy. They will not fight back for now, but they have a lot of health regeneration. Their armor is full, too. Armor reduces incoming attacks from the front by 60% and from the side by 30%. However, the armor is damaged for the same amount it blocks. Try a simple attack first. Your mate needs to stand next to their target.	Good. To proceed, destroy the enemies armor (green bar). Remember, armor does not block attacks from the back, and thus can only be destroyed from the front or side.	This dummy target has a too high health regen to be killed by attacking directly. You can use invigorate to enhance the next attack of an ally. It will deal double damage. The ability stacks, dealing triple damage if used twice on the same target, however it will fizzle if you let 200 time ticks pass. For comparison, a full turn ability uses 100 time ticks. You can check active status effects by clicking on the mates icon.	Well, your next attack will deal double damage. Sacrificial attack deals 80% bonus damage, while also hurting yourself for your base damage. In order to kill the dummy target, you need to stack invigorate again, then use sacrificial attack. Alternatively, you could use sacrificial attack ones while invigorated, and a second time on your next turn.
