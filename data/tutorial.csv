tutorial basic movement	Welcome to the first tutorial. Try to move your mate by clicking “move” on the right side, then choose a destination.	Check out the 4 bars on top of your mate: Health in red, armor in green, mana in blue and time in white. The time bar empties after each turn and refills over time. When full, the time bar turns yellow and your mates next turn begins. Check it out and move a little, or continue the tutorial by trying out his next ability: rookie charge.	Good. As you may have thought, rookie charge allows your mate to move like a rook in chess. Pun not intended. Next, try bishop charge.	Easy, right? Now that’s how the bishop moves. You may have noticed that normal movement does not use all of your time bar, but only half of it. Major abilities like rookie and bishop charge need the full time bar. Minor abilities like normal move, passing the turn or knights move only use half of it. Finish this tutorial by jumping like a knight.	Well done. You can continue to move a little, and check out how mana and time bars work, but you will probably want to fight. Check out the next tutorial when you are ready.			
tutorial basic attacking	Look, an enemy. They will not fight back for now, but they have a lot of health regeneration. Their armor is full, too. Armor reduces incoming attacks from the front by 60% and from the side by 30%. However, the armor is damaged for the same amount it blocks. Try a simple attack first. Your mate needs to stand next to their target.	As you can see, the enemy lost some armor and health, but quickly regenerated all health lost. Try a pierce attack next, which pierces armor and damages health directly at the cost of some mana.	The amount of damage armor can block is reduced if you stand sideways to the enemy (in the same row) . You can completely pierce armor with a normal attack by standing behind the enemy (in a higher column than him). Try that now, move to a higher column and attack with a normal attack.	Good. As you can see, the health regeneration of this dummy enemy is very high, and you can’t kill him this way. To proceed, destroy the enemies armor (green bar). Remember, armor does not block attacks from the back, and thus can only be destroyed from the front or side. Move to either the front or side and attack repeatedly.	Good, now as you destroyed the enemies armor, you can try to kill him with one big blow. You can use invigorate to enhance the next attack of any ally. It will deal double damage. The ability stacks, dealing triple damage if used twice on the same target, however it will fizzle if you let 200 time ticks pass without reapplying or using the buff. For comparison, a full turn ability uses 100 time ticks. You can check active status effects by clicking on the mates icon.	Good, you successfully applied the buff invigorated to your mate. Your next attack will deal double damage. Sacrificial attack deals 80% bonus damage, while also hurting yourself for your base damage. In order to kill the dummy target with a single blow, attack it with a sacrificial attack while the status effect invigorated is still active.	Good. Try the next tutorial to learn about shields.	
tutorial shields	This enemy now will hit you back, and he also has a shield to block incoming attacks. Luckily your mate has a buckler, too. Shields and bucklers block damage from the front and side, similar to armor. However, they do not wear down upon blocking. Use shield raise now to increase the amount of damage your buckler blocks for 200 time ticks.	Good. Now use your spearman to attack the enemy. Note that the spear can attack at a longer range than the axe, as it can additionally hit squares two steps away in any straight line. The spear can hit past allies and enemies, too.	As you can see, the combination of shield and armor reduces incoming damage drastically. On his next turn, the enemy will hit your mate. Only raising your shield will not kill him. Use shield breaker on your next turn. It decreases the effectiveness of shields for all incoming attacks during the next 200 ticks.	Good, you broke your opponents shield. You can check active status effects by clicking a mates icon. As long as this debuff remains, it is a good time to attack! You will notice that your spear mate will have two turns before your axe mates next turn. Lighter equipment allows mates to refresh their turns with less time ticks used. Heavy equipment like shields force mates to use more time ticks for each of their turns. Click each of the mates icons to check their time information.	Now, the broken shield debuff ran out. You can apply it again, but your mate lost some health. You should first use your spear mates heal ability to fill it up.	Now you should know everything to kill this shielded enemy. What are you waiting for?
